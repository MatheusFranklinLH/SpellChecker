# SpellChecker

A python simple Spell Checker, made in order to improve the knowledge learned in Alura's Python for Data Science certification.

# DataSet

The corpus used to train my spell checker was the "artigos.txt" file, which contains several articles available on the Alura website.
Contains 17652 different portuguese words.

The test dataset was the "palavras.txt" file, which contains 186 words arranged in lines where first comes the correct word and then the same word misspeled.
